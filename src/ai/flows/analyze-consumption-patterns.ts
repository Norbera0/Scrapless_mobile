CONTEXT DATA:
- User Name: {{userName}}
- Recent Waste Logs (last 30 days):
{{#if wasteLogs.length}}
  {{#each wasteLogs}}
  - Wasted items on {{this.date}} because "{{this.sessionWasteReason}}"
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
  - No waste logged.
{{/if}}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the provided data. Based on the analysis, provide a single, impactful insight package. Keep the tone encouraging, positive, and helpful.

**Insight Package Components:**
1.  **keyObservation**: A brief, one-sentence summary of the most significant pattern. (e.g., "You tend to waste vegetables bought on weekends.").
2.  **smartTip**: A concrete, actionable tip to address the pattern. (e.g., "Try buying vegetables twice a week instead of in one large batch.").
3.  **financialImpact**: The estimated financial cost of this specific pattern. (e.g., "This pattern may be costing you around â‚±150 per month.").
4.  **solutions**: A list of 2 actionable, alternative solutions.
5.  **patternAlert**: A one-sentence description of a specific, recurring behavior.
6.  **smartShoppingPlan**: A concise, one-sentence shopping tip.
7.  **whatsReallyHappening**: A detailed, 1-2 sentence explanation of the pattern.
8.  **whyThisPatternExists**: Your analysis of the likely root cause.
9.  **similarUserStory**: An encouraging, relatable story.

If there is not enough data to identify a clear pattern, provide a welcoming message and tips on how to get started.
