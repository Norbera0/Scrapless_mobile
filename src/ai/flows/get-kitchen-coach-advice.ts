Your task is to provide a single, quick insight based on the user's data. This should be a 1-2 sentence overview.

## INPUT DATA STRUCTURE
The input will be a single JSON object with two keys: "summaryMetrics" and "rawData". Use "summaryMetrics" for high-level pattern recognition and "rawData" to find specific examples for storytelling.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Generate a single analysis focusing on the most impactful pattern. The 'title' must be a short, engaging 1-2 sentence insight. After the insight, add the sentence: "To learn more go to the Kitchen Coach to ask for more advice."

The output JSON must strictly follow this schema.

    "rootCause": ["Why this happens (psychological/cultural reasons, referencing the user persona, 2-3 bullets)"]
